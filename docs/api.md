# APIs and Flows

The APIs defined in this specification are both synchronous and asynchronous in nature. As a rule of thumb, wherever there is a need to know the status of something in real-time, for instance getting the status of a linking flow or consent flow, we use the synchronous APIs. The rest of the specification use the asynchronous APIs.
