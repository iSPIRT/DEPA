# Consent artefact

In our framework, consent is always electronically sought from the user and is captured using a document called the _Consent Artefact_. The notion of a consent artefact is defined in a [technical standard](http://dla.gov.in/sites/default/files/pdf/MeitY-Consent-Tech-Framework%20v1.1.pdf) released by the [Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY)](https://meity.gov.in/).

In DEPA, we use a JSON version of the Consent Artefact schema of that standard.

The specific definition of the Consent Artefact may be agreed upon by all the participants in the network. [Here](https://github.com/iSPIRT/DEPA/blob/0.2/specs/consent.yaml), we only provide a specification for the most minimal consent artefact.
